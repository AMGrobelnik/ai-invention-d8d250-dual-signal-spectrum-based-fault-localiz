## Repository Structure

Artifacts are grouped by the round of invention that produced them. Each
artifact has its own folder with source code and a self-contained demo:

```
.
├── round-1/                         # One folder per round of invention
│   ├── experiment-1/
│   │   ├── README.md                # What this artifact is
│   │   ├── src/                     # Full workspace from execution
│   │   │   ├── method.py            # Main implementation
│   │   │   ├── method_out.json      # Full output data
│   │   │   └── ...                  # All execution artifacts
│   │   └── demo/                    # Self-contained demo
│   │       └── method_code_demo.ipynb # Colab-ready notebook (code + data inlined)
│   ├── dataset-1/
│   │   ├── src/
│   │   └── demo/
│   └── evaluation-1/
│       ├── src/
│       └── demo/
├── paper.pdf                        # Research paper
├── paper_latex/                     # LaTeX source files
└── README.md
```

## Running Notebooks

### Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended)

Click the "Open in Colab" badges above to run notebooks directly in your browser.
No installation required!

### Option 2: Local Jupyter

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/AMGrobelnik/ai-invention-d8d250-dual-signal-spectrum-based-fault-localiz
cd ai-invention-d8d250-dual-signal-spectrum-based-fault-localiz

# Install dependencies
pip install jupyter

# Run any artifact's demo notebook
jupyter notebook <artifact_folder>/demo/
```

## Source Code

The original source files are in each artifact's `src/` folder.
These files may have external dependencies - use the demo notebooks for a self-contained experience.
